# üì§ Manual GitHub Upload Instructions

Since Git is not installed, here's how to upload your project manually:

## üåê Step-by-Step Manual Upload

### 1. Go to Your GitHub Repository
- Open your browser
- Navigate to: https://github.com/walker-ziro/workcity-assessment-backend

### 2. Upload Files
- Click the **"uploading an existing file"** link or **"Add file" > "Upload files"**
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT upload the `.env` file (it contains sensitive data)

### 3. Select Files to Upload
Select and drag ALL files and folders EXCEPT `.env`:

**‚úÖ Files to Upload:**
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `server.js`
- `seed.js`
- `.env.example` (safe template)
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- `API_EXAMPLES.md`
- `QUICK_START.md`
- `TEST_RESULTS.md`
- `GITHUB_SETUP.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md`
- `src/` folder (entire directory)
- `.vscode/` folder (if needed)

**‚ùå DO NOT Upload:**
- `.env` (contains your actual JWT secret and sensitive data)
- `node_modules/` (should be ignored by .gitignore)
- `coverage/` (test coverage reports)

### 4. Create Commit
- **Commit message:** "Initial commit: Complete RESTful API with all requested features

Features implemented:
- JWT-based authentication (signup/login)
- User roles: admin, user
- CRUD operations for Clients and Projects
- Fetch projects by client endpoint
- Input validation using Joi schemas
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for Create Client and Update Project endpoints
- Security features (rate limiting, CORS, password hashing)
- Complete documentation and API examples

Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, Joi, Jest"

### 5. Commit Changes
- Click **"Commit changes"**

## üîê Security Reminder

Your `.env` file stays on your local machine and contains:
```
JWT_SECRET=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6
```

This is correct and secure! Users will create their own `.env` from the `.env.example` template.

## ‚úÖ After Upload Verification

Your repository should contain:
- All source code and documentation
- Working package.json with all dependencies
- Complete API implementation
- Test suites
- Documentation files
- Environment template (.env.example)

## üöÄ Next Steps

After upload, your repository will be ready for:
- Cloning by other developers
- Immediate setup and testing
- Production deployment
- Code review and collaboration

The API is production-ready with all requested features!
